They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Integration\" - all of the compatibility materials, recipes, and enhancements to make the Thermal Series play even better alongside some common - and not so common - mods. The goal is to blend both style and functionality without compromising or unbalancing the larger modded ecosystem, so config options are in place to quickly disable entire feature sets.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options.\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16]https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

Mekanism is an *experience* that will forever change the way you play Minecraft.\n\nHere at Mekanism, Inc., we bring you a suite of low, mid, and high tier machinery to elevate your archaic home and inefficient resource processing to the 21st century. With our collection of high-tech tools, high-end energy generators, advanced transmission systems and intricate processing mechanisms, you’ll find yourself relieved of the tedious tasks of ‘mining’ and ‘crafting’ and quickly progressing to new levels of technological enlightenment.\n\nYou may not realize it, but every time you smelt an ore directly into its respective ingot, you’re wasting the majority of what you’ve mined. Mekanism’s team of experienced chemical and mechanical engineers have developed advanced ore processing machinery to extract resources from ores with utmost efficiency. With our purification, dissolution, chemical injection, and crystallization technologies, you can now double, triple, quadruple, even *quintuple* your ingot production per ore, given enough infrastructure and energy.\n\nOur engineering team understands and embraces gradual technological progression. For whatever stage of gameplay you’ve reached, we offer a tier of machinery to suit your needs. Every Mekanism machine can be upgraded to a factory, allowing you to process, 3 (basic), 5 (advanced), 7 (elite), or even 9 (ultimate) different items at once -- in a single machine! No more are the rows, even *walls* of slow and ugly furnaces that once plagued your home. Condense your machinery infrastructure with Mekanism today.\n\nJust a few of the many reasons Mekanism will be the highlight of your Minecraft experience:\n- Hydrogen-powered **Jetpacks**, with multiple togglable flight modes\n- A small, cute, and loyal robotic friend (**Robit**!) to follow you around\n- A **Digital Miner** with state-of-the-art filtering technologies to automate your mining needs\n- A **Fusion Reactor** which uses advanced [internal confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion) technology to harness the power of the sun to run advanced machinery (*requires Mekanism Generators*)\n- Various transmitters for transferring items, fluids, gases, energy, and even heat!\n- An effective machinery configuration system, which allows for the creation of advanced item transport networks capable of sorting and filtering (using our patented **Logistical Transporters**!)\n\nLinks to other Mekanism modules:\n- [Mekanism Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-additions)\n- [Mekanism Generators](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-generators)\n- [Mekanism Tools](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-tools)\n\n<br>\n\nWe **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** playing Mekanism with CyanideX's Unity: Dark Edition resource pack.\n- [Unity: Dark Edition](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity-dark-edition/)\n- [Classic Unity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity/)","published":"2022-05-27T00:12:09.740488Z","updated":"2023-11-14T13:14:30.062285Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":114747,"followers":227,"categories":["equipment","storage","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["gqJMEABX","wukmoSeF","4QWCUteA","ruRBKgwc","KIzASRO5","dZZ4j18G","4IEoyWzh","IDjtJsDR","ZrS7qENE","nDxFueG2","DlhxRTKL","atcAq1UT","Pz4thLN2","ppz3xziS","g74zfl0m","RGlXXgcD","zWt8Aemn","zLHaraw3","yDOSRo2r","6zqf3EGe","OFopgIFW","xKRR7R7a","RBifwW3R","TAyUJAKw","X58zIngK","CgFgCgTf","yj7d33HE","MLG4wWo6","W5PUUWt9","GxZSvUQi","5fXP0XBe","52nOMLHi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ce6I4WUE/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"52nOMLHi","project_id":"Ce6I4WUE","author_id":"81DWsUKb","featured":false,"name":"10.4.5.19","version_number":"10.4.5.19","changelog":"<a href=\"https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/e01e5df2d34cff97b2d56d3ebe73378e77432268\">e01e5df</a> -

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything

Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

Refined Storage is a mass storage mod for Minecraft that offers the player a network-based storage system, allowing them to store items and fluids on a massively expandable device network.\n\nItems and fluids can be stored in one of the many storage capabilities that the mod offers. Any storage devices connected to the same network are accessible to the player through one simple Grid interface, allowing the player to access the inventories of many devices through a single unified GUI.\n\nThis mod not only adds storage solutions, but also devices that can be used to manipulate items and blocks in the world and from within the system, such as importers, exporters, constructors, destructors, and more! There are also devices in this mod that allow the player to setup auto-crafting, allowing the crafting of complex recipes in a few simple clicks.\n","published":"2023-07-04T19:57:06.910375Z","updated":"2023-11-26T12:11:57.798784Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":40721,"followers":66,"categories":["storage","technology","transportation"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["oowA5Iwd","YZ0XR5II","HK9EOQ6p","aCrAVeyn","lSA2ilHm","CCtmznuk","1u9nLHLo","rHueOf4K","6XyJwQKE","qRdhlTZp","FfIoyI6k","bcveRhzK","b2wDRWW0","YArOFHJ8","QqMSPKBK","awgGK8og","diMuliGc","U4nNlVxy","9FSDP48t","zPblpnEM","FySVyBpx","MQWT9X6A","UtZkUUCC","VT4IJBdn","LHsKBCVY","ji5sIFmE","JKXOx3U4","tsV0so7y","wByAoycD","2Sdp1wuJ","I4OZ1vjL","l3Hj2lCH","4lAVcnxE","yZKcLCtD","ZWIMoEm4","FFosy93i","otIZHPMB","Lgcu6H34","XrNGoESV","9HIc9bq8","ZJJrTq6j","jR0gHa8j","pGA1mssN","Lf8A87Lm","wmpOUSBT","bcaF7u53","XB1hEZZU","XKhMNnMe","5pDg4ocp","K1YTksBI","YSl9RdcK","vDN0DgIt","JBciyoWo","DokWcz17","oYb3BY8l","jZ84LrRR","aRcAgbFe","WiGHtCXv","E3XCJ2TW","X4typAJg","3088TO5v","SBfLibBt","ScUf0R8q","zFl6azVW","JCjhS9wH","NFMdTqLm","jK7AAj6u","PudOOyk9","Eq7JaN60","cCwA23Yj","EoYGhGlT","XjPaOboi","loHh6k6J","ru9HTua0","2Gpz1XMC","iR6GHjuH","YEvBoSCx","NZfnBHnF","X8KPs07l","VfYyJ2IJ","zBAFajps","dIfSILQG","uW06BZym","70sTOize","NRLMtFLA","xr5S678d","t1QPUhlp","t1KRd03U","N7kjrUuq","gL1kQrec","2lZ9sQgb","oWHL6FCy","2toxAjDL","ObjqCEtC","ei75WFFQ","aYtH6Iyj","rxSPbKKz","tMS7tS3l","jrlKwDdU","ebflXOrE","kOZYWqvv","XXDjnJjb","ubVR7Qo2","LgOoLMb3","9FdMY5Uh","q0upZGyZ","JtP0PfDW","rLxnC9rX","KQUlf68j","Q0JvA1hs","9A44DGnE","nyFJpM9r","5LJgalvR","b3EnMurH","WXc7Lduy","1KnpObYz","OCkiDRqI","G3U09EQR","o2cBXo5K","obWjt4eG","IfASYu3s","ZwA2eWbr","lduq40MS","bqOGk9wF","SMmGjwzY","E6IGnQVV","GstFHtQu","2PhMGrPC","lJWYzpXy","p2pc3XkZ","aFEIrETt","GH3gS21C","xEybRLzR","swrHncYx","PJJvJnrc","Map4zjlx","dNBGpoJE","rG3uuKl9","MjxkrtDM","eyqekIYi","oiiKEr6C","E1cAiFLP","AdgoNEer","vYmGIsfv","OOG4TZdH","b8RJOn2m","NUXYAExM","gtJEVdC4","9nMM8BQd","PuKbgH68","8WrJfY2W","i3HoGPiT","Y1Spkg9x","9bPnZGVd","BNdtdvCF","zd9efSD4","mz38svG6","aXkKelNh","4TWwqV8M","1j5w4uTI","o7aP9aNA","otvP5RZZ","p2TmY5gl","QiYjDNCR","MvQHq8zk","VnAoDoy4","YEzRaiSl","PxiUp4pX","MXhJ6DEx","Zk4gZCdu","SybYrvdy","2ccDXLcI","Qk9oKmsE","RjD1Ok08","XlrINGwZ","G5PUHGAS","ECyJMVne","Tc2gNFEM","zYkzZ6Xc","a5e5AmCN","DN8Ndu2z","toGMhAa9","SsaOW1Yw","j5lD9SbE","8t7bcFA9","AsQLO343","GCFUJQJZ","VqvidqKg","axXYroni","2B7oLBNz","5z23XIQC","fmgKjOC6","H33Uj6Nl","sVAWpSX7","liJvph0l","PrJ56qWO","BELprT7d","93bqP28J","11oqJDaD","PXGnRC2r","X9Cp27r1","KSkh6Cmx","wEzhu0F6","CleXWjNW","mYiMojAz","rBWghJM3","Bq0JVXcm","5QS0MMSd","IX4Uxowu","bNAyBCTf","aVBhDTuO","g6Q8lhxz","qbD7GpRs","YmTvTSr5","gbf0Byhx","IA9VYo9N","i4l5Nhss","7Dtzai2a","o6pw67te","eXbe0Vzy","WD1pFMBR","MzQ0XcZA","HGQ0nVyD","hEt2dHSt","A6eJcOW1","t5HOPjQj","R0JZjvEg","HVJXQFgA","LAuDZDb1","NcJeKAfX","zGJtrgXl","sv5wexKZ","CwaJX9mJ","Z4ZwfsmH","DlxhxAMG","ubJGKwUA","hAfmTW4i","yttzXk4M","pZhGDWZf","F1AuMcg9","Qf5sD6tZ","2P23ravQ","O5LHCcWZ","Os6A9619","gAZ6iwUG","xm4PUTvq","dSDQRLVO","YbG0afid","vxhFf3p6","DiI2vAev","ZITLFjjf","q3LiZwUb","KylQm6oT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KDvYkUg3/be094d898dbfe003baaa6e86098145eec8dbec9b.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"ZITLFjjf","project_id":"KDvYkUg3","author_id":"R9RLzzR6","featured":false,"name":"v1.12.4","version_number":"1.12.4","changelog":"###

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-12-11T21:15:39.285813Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2911936,"followers":4173,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.8.8","1.8.9","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"17Hi340V","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:07:52.006115Z","downloads":226943,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"14f6b9b3161d6ebeaefaa1efc08b72a98d82aacf6f9956c3a5bff9daaae3d0200cfdb2034c2321849acf0aafaf0450cbd075a92138e1500f31a70666c59e258f","sha1":"a184f3a963c07f7026fb6d8ccd83ca29e7f7b009"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/17Hi340V/entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":62127,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar":{"sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uXXizFIs","slug":"ferrite-core","project_type":"mod","team":"2JhABx1f","title":"FerriteCore","description":"Memory usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2402659,"followers":4414,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":114379,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c","sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\smarterfarmers-1.20-1.8.0.jar":{"sha512":"e16818df405c7e8b50acf80e42cdd913758f67cdee98ef3aa8ba051ac74d84917f49baf5cd604f445ae4070040142827ceb16ec41800a8f6c66445035d933177","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Bh6ZOMvp","slug":"smarter-farmers-farmers-replant","project_type":"mod","team":"p0y6SQY5","title":"Smarter Farmers (farmers replant)","description":"Allows villagers to replant the correct seed & allows them to use modded ones","body":"<center>\n\n## Smarter Farmers\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/qdKRTDf8Cv\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/790151253144895508?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Discord&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Discord\"></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/mehvahdjukaar\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=mehvahdjukaar&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/Supplementariez\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Supplementariez?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Twitter&message=Twitter&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Youtube&message=Twitter&logoColor=ff0000\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nSmarter Farmers is a very simple mod that makes farmers a bit less dumb\n\nFarmers can now:\n- Interact, plant and replant modded crops\n- Replant crops according to some logic. No longer will they pick the first seed they have but they'll try to replant what they just harvested instead\n- If no crop is being replanted farmers will choose a new crop to plant based on the crops around it. No more lone single patches of carrots n your wheat field!\n- Accept and pick up seeds from said crops & prevent non farmers from doing the same\n- Will equip a hoe while performing their farm task. Its tier depends on their villager level\n- No longer trample farmland\n- Can plant and replant on non non vanilla farmland like blocks, tweaked via a \"farmer_plantable_on\" tag. By default includes blocks like Supplementaries' planter\n- Can harvest special non crop like blocks, tweaked via a \"crop_replaceable\" tag. By default includes stuff like Immersive Weathering's weeds and Overweight Farming and Hefty crops big crop blocks\n- Are immune to sweet berry bush damage\n- In addition all villagers will now accept and breed with any (modded) food item you throw at them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Cultivation\" - a collection of farming and food related things to make your world more agrarian and delicious!\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

Don't get too close!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bass</strong>&nbsp;swim around the murky waters - I bet they taste nice!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Catfish</strong>&nbsp;are larger, taking up space from the Bass. It's a hard life for a fish!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Ducks</strong>&nbsp;waddle around the Swamps, their feet slapping across the ground. They hold many secrets!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Dragonflies</strong>&nbsp;love buzzing around the Swamps! I found a note in a mineshaft that said they liked Chorus Fruit. I wonder what that's about?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lizards</strong>&nbsp;are the recluse of the Swamps and don't like people, but they're very loyal if fed their favorite food!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tortoises</strong>&nbsp;mosey around the Swamp in search of their next meal. They're famous for their hard shells!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>🌳 Woodland Wildlife Update</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Forested and Grassy Biomes are now inhabited by <strong>Bears</strong>, <strong>Birds</strong>, <strong>Butterflies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Caterpillars</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Deer</strong>, <strong>Fireflies</strong>, <strong>Snails</strong>, and <strong>Snakes</strong>!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bears</strong> are the gentle predators of the forest. Don't provoke them or go&nbsp;near their cubs and you'll be fine... unless you're a Deer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Birds</strong> fly around the treetops, chirping as they do so. Maybe they'll be&nbsp;loyal to you in return for food.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Butterflies</strong> flutter about, looking for flowers (and crops) to pollinate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Caterpillars</strong> spawn by breeding butterflies and will crawl around, looking for nearby trees to create a chrysalis on.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Deer</strong> walk and run across the world, munching grass and avoiding Bears.&nbsp;I wonder if there's a way to mimic their movement?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Fireflies</strong> light up the night and can be found in biomes such as Forests,&nbsp;Plains, and Swamps. Would it be weird if you consumed one?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snails</strong> crawl around the forest floor... aimlessly. As Snails do. Be careful&nbsp;you don't jump on them, or they might meet an unkindly fate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snakes</strong> are lower forest predators, consuming the smaller animals&nbsp;that Bears can't be bothered to hunt.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">🦁 <strong>Deserted Drylands Update</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Dry biomes such as Savannas and Deserts are now inhabited by <strong>8 new animals</strong>; <strong>Lions</strong>, <strong>Giraffes</strong>, <strong>Elephants</strong>, <strong>Hippos</strong>, <strong>Rhinos</strong>, <strong>Vultures</strong>, <strong>Zebras</strong>, and <strong>Boars</strong>!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lions</strong> are the rulers of the Savanna, and will hunt mobs at night. Be careful though, they won&rsquo;t hesitate to fight back!</span></li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Giraffes</strong> are gentle giants. If you feed them a Golden Apple, they&rsquo;ll allow you to ride them for 30 seconds. During this time, Maps&rsquo; radius are greatly increased. To breed them, use a Hay Bale!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Elephants</strong> mosey around, minding their own business. They fight back when attacked.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hippos</strong> tend to stay near the water, but watch out, because they&rsquo;re <em>always</em> hungry! They&rsquo;ll attack boats and any Players that go into their pool. To breed them, feed them a Glistering Melon or a Melon Block while they&rsquo;re in the water.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rhinos</strong> are generally docile unless they have a baby with them. If aggro&rsquo;d, or if their baby is approached, they will scrape their foot 4-5 times before <em><strong>charging!</strong></em></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Vultures</strong> fly around, squawking in the air. Come nightfall, they&rsquo;ll attack <strong>Zombies.</strong> When Players are low on health, Vultures will swoop down, stealing the item in the Player&rsquo;s hand. If a Vulture steals an item, they&rsquo;ll carry it around while flying. If Rotten Flesh is dropped on the ground, they&rsquo;ll trade out the item they&rsquo;re holding.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Zebras</strong> are the Savanna&rsquo;s equivalent of Horses, and are tameable in a similar way. They&rsquo;re a slippery bunch though, and will run away if approached! However, once tamed, they run faster than Horses while in water, and can be chested.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Boars</strong> are neutral animals that replace Pigs in Savanna biomes. When attacked, they will fight back, and run away when low on health. I wonder what happens if they&rsquo;re struck by lightning..</span></li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For more detailed information about each mob, click <a href=\"https://github.com/starfish-studios/Naturalist/wiki\">here</a> to read our official wiki.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><b>⚠️</b> Frequently Asked Questions&nbsp;<b>⚠️</b></strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><strong>Q : Can I use this mod in my modpack or make videos about it?</strong><br />A : Yes!

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

To be more precise, it is not an additional mod for Craft Tweaker, but simply adds a visual editor to the game and automatic code generation in Zen Script.\n\nIt is very easy to use this mod, it is enough to install the mod on the server and client, if desired, you can install Craft Tweaker for ease of development, but this is optional. Thanks to this, you can start creating your own recipes for assembly even before the official release of Craft Tweaker on this version. Thus, the recipes will not work in the game, but when the craft tweaker is installed, they will all work.\n\nAfter installing JCTGUI and CT on the server and client, you can start creating the first recipe. To do this, open the chat and register the beginning of the command \"/ctgui\" and press the space bar. Then you will have several options for crafting blocks. At the moment, only \"crafting_table\" is supported and press the space bar. Next, you need to select an action. At the moment, you can only \"open\". As a result, our command should look something like this before executing:\n\n <h4>/ctgui crafting_table open</h4>\n\nThen we will open the GUI itself. Before opening, take the items from which you want to craft into your inventory. When the GUI is open, you can see an interface similar to crafting table, in which you need to lay out the recipe. Creating using items from other mods is possible, but errors may occur. When you have posted your recipe, you can click the Generate button to generate Zen Script code. The generated code will appear in your chat and you can check it for errors if you understand this language. Then you can click the Save button and the recipe will be automatically saved to the Scripts folder called generated1.zs. It is not possible to choose the name of the recipe and file manually yet, and this happens automatically.\n\nNow that the recipe has been created, you need to update the list of Craft Tweaker recipes. This can be done by logging back into minecraft or by running the command below:\n\n<h4>/reload</h4>\n\n<h3>A little history of creation and plans for the future.</h3>\n\nThis mod was created by me for myself and was supposed to help me create my minecraft builds, but soon a bug occurred, because of which I could not continue development. And today, as I write this, I fixed this bug and improved the code generation mechanism.\n\nHere are some plans for the future and a roadmap for the development of the mod, the elements in it are distributed according to the degree of importance and complexity of implementation:\n\n1. Support for the number of items as a result of the recipe. - Done\n\n2. Adding support for shapeless recipes to the crafting table. - Done\n\n3. The ability to rename the file and the recipe name directly from the GUI. - Done\n\n4. Adding support for more vanilla blocks for recipes. \n\n5. The ability to use other Zen Script functionality.\n\n6. Adding support for custom blocks for recipes.\n\nMy discord server:

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains both \"Core\" and \"Foundation\" - a collection of common components, resources, and tools.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options.\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

If you are using other mods that also spawn structures in villages, you may need to increase the generation number of Chef's Delight structures in the config file.\n\nThe file is configured in a way that it generates structures randomly and can be different for each biome. \n**Put 0** to not generate the structures. \n\nStructures for Snow Plains and Savanna biomes will be added in a future update.\n\n### Config for Forge:\nA configuration file is generated in the Minecraft config folder with the name \"**chefsdelight-common.toml**\" allowing to change the number of houses that are generated in the villages. (still in test)\n\n### Config for Fabric:\nA configuration file is generated in the Minecraft config folder with the name \"**chefsdelightconfig.properties**\" allowing to change the number of houses that are generated in the villages.

I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods if you would like to discuss, provide suggestions, etc.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nGenerally Embeddium should work out of the box with many more mods than Rubidium. However, given the scope of changes\nit makes to the renderer, it may have compatibility issues with some mods that use advanced rendering. Please open an\nissue if you experience problems. Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it.

API","description":"A flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers.","body":"Curios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2024-02-07T10:08:02.171174Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":303753,"followers":233,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm","sVuCrC2E","DtYuKcQY","3VUlU5Ga","rAPky5mo","iy9E6HF4","qlWryz6z","MjnZWw5h","fPjcw2f6","anCi5HAr","U8r7nIbi","9hjtlBBI","fAlF6Tqn","nxZSj82i","PeTgKttm","t01OqNOZ","LgpxZ1yG"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"rAPky5mo","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-5.5.0+1.20.1","version_number":"5.5.0+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\nPrior to version 5.2.0, this project used [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

Energistics 2","description":"AE2: A popular automation and storage mod","body":"Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) is a comprehensive mod for Minecraft that introduces a unique approach to in-game inventory management. It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

for KubeJS in the form of a single html file.\n \n\nTo get started, all you have to do is run the `/kubejsoffline` command inside of a single-player world.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

how worlds are loaded to speed up loading times.","body":"# NOTICE!!!!!!\nI (StockiesLad) have quit modding again. This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":951383,"followers":1178,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"5caSj7kt","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Fastload 3.4.0 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-3.4.0","changelog":"bump version.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-15T12:36:55.631401Z","downloads":78081,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b8be6ed0bef707c7c34d84049eb68313a5c787f6e9c9a88fb94daed6bccfedc6c181a1fca431f53b6e8ac03c7baf7653414b5a5792cab6b500c6d66502489431","sha1":"27d58f123951e0404c94caf16ff9b96b442f371c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/5caSj7kt/Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":66989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"KirboSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a junior software engineer who creates minecraft mods in my spare time and help with projects when I can","created":"2022-06-04T15:56:54.106893Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Co-owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar"},"mods\\UniversalBoneMeal-v8.0.1-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"16ffcf0ee8b7d7219a9380856b205f2f1ba255a41c29eda1f87f0c363250915e4f94889f0c5ccbf68d53c3d57266bba01e796f703902522f4bb43f93b2cc35bd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"66VIiT1y","slug":"universal-bone-meal","project_type":"mod","team":"fpH5sHHX","title":"Universal Bone Meal","description":"Stop the bonemeal discrimination!

style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Pumpkins and Melons</strong> can be forced to appear from a fully grown stem, although this usally takes a few tries</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:

Blocks</strong> can be farmed by growing coral plants into coral reef structures, but this only works inside of a warm ocean biome, and corals are also very picky where to grow, so make sure no sea pickles and sea grass are anywhere above the coral plant</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Grass Blocks or Mycelium</strong> will be forced to spread when using bone meal on a dirt/coarsed dirt/dirt path block, when a grass block/mycelium is directly next to it, just like spreading nylium onto netherrack</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sweet Berry Bushes and Fern</strong> can be grown on podzol, similar to grass and flowers from grass blocks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">All new behaviors also work with dispensers and

mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

creating wine but also for building up your own Vinery.</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n \n \n__Features__\n<br>\n- A new crafting system for making wine \n- Multiple variants of wine which will affect you differently (in a positive way - were still in minecraft :))\n- New bushes and trees \n- Lots of decorative blocks \n- Slabs! Dirt, coarse dirt and grass slabs\n- Finally a flower pot thats big enough so you can place tall flowers in it \n- Collect a new armor set and make use of its unique set bonus\n- A new type of wood\n- New villager profession and a new wandering trader \n<br>\n… and more\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n\n__Getting started__\n<br>\n<br>\nYou'll need to find grapevine bushes to gather your first Grapes. If you cant find any a Wandering Winemaker will make visit from time to time maybe offering some seeds. You can get seeds by eating Grapes.\nAfter harvesting your first Grapes can either just eat them or put them into a Pot and crush them by jumping and walking around in it. Then you can extract Grapejuice by using Empty Winebottles. Filled Winebottles can be refined in a Barrel by using extra Ingredients such as Sweetberries, Honey and so on. Different sort of Grapejuice and Ingredients result in different Wine. \n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nThere are actually 4 different varieties of Grapes available: \nLight, Heavy, vigorous and resilient. Each of them are found in different biomes and will affect your wines different. For example: You can find resilient Grapes mostly in Jungle Biomes and you can craft mostly Wines with the ability to heal with it. Heavy Grapes are found in cold Biomes; such as Taiga or Old Growth Pine Forests. Most Wines crafted with heavy Grapes will give you the ability to increase your Protection. \nHaving troubles finding Grapes or Seeds? A Wandering Winemaker will visit you from time to time - he might offer Seeds for a few Emeralds. \n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nFeeling lost? There are some built-in recipe Books which will show you some recipes or potential Ingredients. Not the exact syntax - that you’ll have to figure out on yourself. \n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n <center>So... find out, experiment but most important of all:\n__have fun doing it__ ! \n</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<center>1.19.2 and above requires Architectury</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n <center>Dedicated to MissLilitu</center>\n \n ","published":"2022-12-25T20:26:15.467316Z","updated":"2024-02-09T08:07:25.174564Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":137677,"followers":397,"categories":["decoration","food","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","mobs"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["ElYCmfzG","cLYVl6S1","ibob4Vu4","4YHsRe89","ZaCY1vw9","6q9rjLLG","vJstllIR","DLJi1txg","PghjLKYV","3CPQOoVg","ylAN9jih","OciiuCdK","SDUDBaYK","EzxsNX0U","hesHLBqA","yoCi7Sml","ekaWYm76","UI4Iw0WZ","e2yr5WLF","gDrp8atK","iTD6I6Ed","cnSjIQSK","SxiAveF9","3a8O93DI","ZKf9XOxr","10tQdbP9","k0PPuM7v","Sw5iO5kw","DkMFggNc","3wS2kq8q","6RYNXMDN"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1DWmBJVA/04b7d7f72a11534bd7fdc92e2031e16c97be946e.png"},"version":{"id":"Sw5iO5kw","project_id":"1DWmBJVA","author_id":"u5d114le","featured":false,"name":"Let's Do: Vinery 1.4.7","version_number":"1.4.7","changelog":"# Vinery 1.4.7 - 1.20.1\n* Fixed an OutOfBound Error caused by the CompostableRegistry (Cristelknight)\n* Fixed a PlacementError when using DynamicCrosshair (Cristelknight)\n* Improved the SpreadableGrassSlabBlock (Cristelknight)\n* AppleTreeSaplings won’t replace the Dirt Ground below it anymore when they grow \n* Added conditional Recipes for create ","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-06T11:07:20.425636Z","downloads":7789,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"18f10a28cd8bc32c34a044768d586ee0e2e04f47","sha512":"f8a5a80157826bc3330cb9e847c3c95a18d6917c2ff81fc1724351bb73b28f7a4ef4427c318fc22930564a0e8b09f9e6cc6900d90542b34a157c4ec7f1161534"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1DWmBJVA/versions/Sw5iO5kw/letsdo-vinery-1.4.7-forge.jar","filename":"letsdo-vinery-1.4.7-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":2608656,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"4XJZeZbM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"lhGA9TYQ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"S5MKtl8I","user":{"id":"g7PU4vft","username":"IamJannik","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104758303?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-06-18T14:31:59.745426Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"S5MKtl8I","user":{"id":"3tNWgp1O","username":"Cristelknight","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54945257?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-03T10:38:22.510785Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Mascot","ordering":0},{"team_id":"S5MKtl8I","user":{"id":"u5d114le","username":"satisfyu","name":"mrclb - Marco","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104036234?v=4","bio":"Hey!","created":"2022-12-25T20:25:04.521571Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"letsdo-vinery-1.4.7-forge.jar"},"mods\\additionaladditions-6.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"b818c2981d63c70e555750c3f8e9cd03ea3f02f74a348dd12b0f52f4656e9dfb2424c8ea78fa49805ba585f4804fdda5a96c54d6f740a9afd4f6810223965289","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"R4TvILfj","slug":"addadd","project_type":"mod","team":"UH8kkCJK","title":"Additional Additions","description":"Additional Additions is a mod that aims to add additional uses for Copper, Amethyst and Glow Ink Sacs as well as other useful additional additions to the game.","body":"![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Additional_Additions/BH_AA_Header.png)\n[![](https://dqu.one/uploads/ukraine_banner.png)](https://u24.gov.ua/)  \n![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Additional_Additions/BH_AA_Overview.png)\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand</summary>\n  \n\n  ### Ropes\n  Use them to climb upwards and downwards with ease.\n  \n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/yG5HId9.png)\n  \n  ### Copper Patina\n  Get it by scraping off the oxidation layer from copper.

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Dynamics\" - containing ducts which allow for transport of Energy and Fluids across distances great and small, as well as additional logistical blocks related to transport.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options (1.18.2 only).\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

This can make a huge difference to frame rates for most computers that are not bottle-necked by the GPU or other components. Even if your GPU can't keep up, you'll experience much more stable frame times thanks to the CPU being able to work on other rendering tasks while it waits.\n- Vertex data for rendered chunks is made much more compact, allowing for video memory and bandwidth requirements to be cut by almost 40%.\nNearby block updates now take advantage of multi-threading, greatly reducing lag spikes caused by chunks needing to be updated.\n- Chunk faces which are not visible (or facing away from the camera) are culled very early in the rendering process, eliminating a ton of geometry that would have to be processed on the GPU only to be immediately discarded. For integrated GPUs, this can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and provide a modest speedup even when GPU-bound.\n- Plentiful optimizations for chunk loading and block rendering, making chunk loading significantly faster and less damaging to frame rates.\n- Many optimizations for vertex building and matrix transformations, speeding up block entity, mob, and item rendering significantly for when you get carried away placing too many chests in one room.\n- Many improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n- Many graphical fixes for smooth lighting effects, making the game run better while still applying a healthy amount of optimization.\n- Smooth lighting for fluids and other special blocks.\n- Smooth biome blending for blocks and fluids, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n

island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

Then you must think about the type of crop you want to grow and the soil it grows in. There are many kinds of soil blocks and certain crops will need certain soils. A good example of this is wheat growing in dirt and nether wart growing in soul sand. Once you have the soil and seed for your crop simply right click the block with your soil and then your seed. This will start the growth process for your crop. The crop may take a while to grow, you can speed it up by right clicking with bone meal and other fertilizers. Once the crop is done growing right click it to harvest and automatically plant another. To remove items from the botany pot you can sneak and right click the block with an empty hand. Breaking the block will also work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While this mod may seem simple on it's surface, there are many technical details involved. For those who would like to get a better understanding of the mod you can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/Technical-Info\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technical Information</a> page on the wiki.</p>\n\n<h2>Mod Support</h2>\n<p>This mod uses predefined json files to add support for crops. These json files let you do things like define soils, fertilizers, and new crops. Mod authors and servers can easily add these files to their data packs to customize crops. Additionally users can create and share their own data packs to enable a broader range of mod support.&nbsp; If you would like to add new data for the mod please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki</a> for more information about the mod and where to get help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently Supported</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biomes O' Plenty (15 crops, 3 soils)</li>\n<li>Botania (32 crops, 7 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Buzzier Bees (13 crops)</li>\n<li>Metal Bushes (6 crops)</li>\n<li>Mystical Agriculture(43 crops, 5 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Harvestcraft (78 crops)</li>\n<li>Peanut Mod (1 crop)</li>\n<li>Quark (1 crop, 1 soil)</li>\n<li>Simple Farming (34 crops)</li>\n<li>Snad (2 soils)</li>\n<li>XL Food Mod (6 crops)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Like the mod and want to support me?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can

biomes to the Overworld, Nether, and End!  To go along with the new biomes, it adds new plants, flowers, trees, building blocks, and much more!\n\n## Info and Terms\n\n### Requires [![GlitchCore Icon](https://i.imgur.com/zC7XoOh.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/glitchcore) [GlitchCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/glitchcore) for Minecraft 1.20.4 and above!  Also requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for Fabric version.\n### Requires [![TerraBlender Icon](https://i.imgur.com/y2BgV5H.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/terrablender) [TerraBlender](https://modrinth.com/mod/terrablender) for Minecraft 1.18 and above! It is not required for 1.17 and below, but in those versions you must use the Biomes O' Plenty world type when creating a new world!\n\nTo use the mod on a server for 1.18 and above, no changes to server.properties are required.  For 1.15/1.16/1.17, the **level-type** setting in server.properties must be set to ***biomesoplenty*** (level-type can be added manually if it does not appear by default).  For 1.12.2 and below, **level-type** must be set to ***BIOMESOP***.  You must use either a new world, or use an NBT editor to make the necessary changes to your existing world, otherwise our biomes will not generate.\n\n*You may include this mod in a Modrinth-hosted modpack as long as you do not rehost the mod and only use builds uploaded directly by us, you do not sell the modpack or additional access to the mod via any means, and you follow any and all terms listed in the license for the version of the mod you are using.*\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n[![BOP Volume 1 Album

Check out the official wiki [here](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki).\n\nThe official FAQ can be found [here](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). Please refer to this and/or the wiki before asking questions, as your question has most likely already been answered here.\n\n## About:\nLightman's Currency adds an item-based money system to the game through coins, which can be used to trade with your friends in a multiplayer environment. All trading machines are protected such that only the owner can break it, and contains an emergency ejection system should a modded mining machine somehow bypass this (or a setblock command). Because of this you may place your trading machines in public areas without risk of theft or griefing even when you're offline, allowing you to safely sell your wares under any and all situations.\n\n## Features:\n* Add a simply item-based money system to the game.\n* Equip-able and upgrade-able Wallets to keep your coins on-hand for purchases without sacrificing inventory space.\n* Wallet-related game rules to allow you to keep only your wallet on death (similar to `keepInventory`), and if you keep that you can use another game rule to make wallets drop a portion of your coins on death instead (terraria-style).\n* Various forms of Trading Machines that can sell any item known to man. They can also buy stuff or even barter 1 item for another if you'd prefer to do things the old fashioned way!\n* Trade Rules that can be applied to individual trade offers, or to the trader as a whole to allow limitations on how your customers may interact with the trader.\n* Admin Tools to allow for Trading Machines with infinite stock. Useful for setting up a way for players to sell common items to the server to gain money!\n* Personal bank accounts for safe money storage regardless of how dangerous your world may be! Trading Machines can also be set up to deposit earnings directly into your bank account!\n* Team system to allow for players to collectively manage a set of traders. Can also have a bank account for collective money storage.\n* Money-related enchantments such as the Coin Magnet enchantment that increases the range of your wallets coin collection, to Money Mending which allows you to pay a monetary fee to repair any equipped tools and armor that have this enchantment.\n* Various specialized traders that only allow the sale of specific item types in exchange for cosmetic or functional upgrades, and even a Paygate trader that allows you to trigger a redstone signal in exchange for payment.\n* Unique Ticket printing system that allows players to trade these unique items as discount coupons, or other creative purposes. Extremely compatible with the Paygate trader, as tickets can be used as an alternative form of payment.\n\n### Configurable Features\n* Monsters drop varying amounts of money. Can be [configured](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Mod-Configuration#common-config)!\n* Certain chests spawn with some loose change. Can be [configured](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Mod-Configuration#common-config)!\n* Options to enable or disable the crafting & melting of coins in the coin mint. Can be [configured](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Mod-Configuration#server-config)!\n* Coins have a defined value visible to all players, and coins of lower value can be exchanged for more valuable coins (or vice versa) at your local ATM Machine.\n* What items are considered coins, as well as their exchange rates can be [configured](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Master-Coin-List-Config)!\n* Wandering traders have additional trades that allow you to purchase some new wares with coins. Can be [disabled](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Mod-Configuration#common-config).\n* Two additional villager types that allow you to purchase nearly anything with the money you've collected. Trades can be [disabled](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Mod-Configuration#common-config), but due to technical limitations the villager type themselves cannot.\n\n\n## Compatibility:\n* All trading machines _should_ be capable of selling any modded item/block.\n* Compatible with the [Curios API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios), replacing my built-in wallet slot with a Curios one.\n* Please report any compatibility issues in the **Issues** tab.\n* Adds additional features to one of my other mods [Lightman's Discord Integration](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lightmans-discord-integration \"Lightman's Discord Integration\")\n* 1.16 does not automatically create recipes for copper coin minting, as there is no copper ingot by default. I have created a bunch of datapacks that add mint/melt recipes for common tech mods that can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/tree/LC-1.16/Recipe%20Datapacks).\n\n## Expansions:\n* [LC Tech](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lc-tech): Adds fluid & energy traders to the game.\n* If you're a mod developer interested in making an expansion mod for Lightman's Currency, feel free to ask me for help on either the discord linked below, or via a curseforge pm. (Discord will have a more immediate response time)\n\n\n## Update Plans:\n\nDue to my limited time to work on my mods, only the latest forge version will receive constant feature and QoL updates. Currently that version is **1.20.1**.\n\nAll other versions will only receive either updates that only include smaller quality of life changes that were added in the latest version, with the **occasional** backport of  latest LC version to bring it up to speed with the latest features. These versions include:\n\n* 1.20.2\n* 1.19.2\n* 1.18.2\n\nAll other versions will not receive any updates at all unless a game-breaking bug/crash is reported (basically anything that make the game literally unplayable without uninstalling my mod)\n\n\n### Screenshots:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IgWXlMz.png \"Scrooge McDuck swimming in his wealth.\")\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IOkkINJ.png \"ShopPic1\")\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IctdD2t.png \"Shop Pic 2\")\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ns08xo.png \"Vending Pic 1\")\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YbxhIz5.png \"Vending Pic 2\")\n\n \n**THIS MOD DOES NOT SUPPORT SERVERS WITH ONLINE_MODE=FALSE, AS PLAYER IDS CAN CHANGE SPONTANEOUSLY IN THIS MODE! PLEASE DO NOT REPORT ANY ISSUES THAT OCCUR WHILE PLAYING ON A SERVER WITH THIS DISABLED!**\n\n**PLEASE REPORT ALL ISSUES IN THE ISSUES TAB AT THE TOP OF THE DESCRIPTION.

functionalities like:\n\n \n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulling Upgrade</strong>: It pulls items from an adjacent inventory\n<li><strong>Pushing Upgrade</strong>: It pushes items to an adjacent inventory\n<li><strong>Collecting Upgrade</strong>: It collects items on the ground\n<li><strong>Armory Cabinet</strong>: It stores 4096 non stackeable items(by default) and can only be accessed with external tools (currently) like Applied Energistics or Refined Storage external storage tools\n<li><strong>Storage Upgrades</strong>: Have changed a a bit, there a less types of them but they give a bigger boost\n<li><strong>Storage Controller</strong>: You can link drawers to it without having direct contact\n<li><strong>Fluid Drawer</strong>: Stores Fluids\n<li><strong>Controller Extensions</strong>: Acts as a Storage Controller when linked to it\n<li><strong>Simple Compacting Drawer</strong>: Its like a compacting drawer but with only 2 slots\n</ul>\n\n\n![Image](https://imgur.com/qF7p3d9.png)\n \n\n<strong>How to use</strong>\n\n \n\n<strong>Drawer controller</strong>: To link a drawer to a drawer controller you need to use a Linking Tool\n<strong>Ender Drawer</strong>: You can copy a drawer frequency by left clicking it with a Linking Tool and then you can right click another Ender Drawer and then they will have their contents synced\n<strong>Linking Tool</strong>: Right + Clicking a controller to configure it then you can link Normal/Compacting/Ender Drawer to a controller by Right Clicking them if they are in range (8 radius by default)\n \n\n<strong>Planned features</strong>\n\nArmory Cabinet easy

mods.</p>\n<p><b>For all my mod devs out there - </b>This provides a lot of useful stuff, especially if you're a worldgen modder!</p>\n<p>The API includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRegistration system (1.18+ only). Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure.

Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2024-01-22T02:29:38.409339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":225025,"followers":510,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF","rFTKVUtq","AxgOboGq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"AxgOboGq","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.4 - 1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.2.4","changelog":"## 1.2.4\n\n### Updates\n- The Cooking Pot item now displays more information than before:\n  - A blue bar will be shown to indicate the amount of meal servings stored, similar to how Bundles display their fullness;\n  - The tooltip will display the stored food's item sprite alongside its name;\n- When viewing basic crops in JEI, they will display info on where they can be found as Wild Crops.\n\n### Fixes\n- (1.20) Creative Tab registration has been moved to server-side, so that other mods can access them for game logic;\n- Structure files for compost heaps are now format-updated with datagen, thus avoiding excessive DFU triggers on world gen.

This mod allows you to add and properly edit recipes of Create mod in KubeJS scripts. All supported recipe types and examples are below. See [Recipes page](https://mods.latvian.dev/books/kubejs/page/recipeeventjs) for more info.\n\nSupported recipe types:\n\n- `createCrushing`\n- `createCutting`\n- `createMilling`\n- `createBasin`\n- `createMixing` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createCompacting` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createPressing`\n- `createSandpaperPolishing`\n- `createSplashing` (Bulk Washing)\n- `createDeploying`\n- `createFilling`\n- `createEmptying`\n\n> Note: Bulk Smoking = vanilla smoking and Bulk Blasting = vanilla blasting recipe types.\n\n`event.recipes.createCrushing(output[], input[])`\nOutput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either items or fluids\nInput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either ingredients or `Fluid.of('minecraft:water', 1000)` or `{fluidTag: 'some:fluid_tag', amount: 1000}`\n\n### `createMechanicalCrafting`\n\n`event.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting(output, pattern[], {patternKey: input})`\n\nThis recipe type is the same as regular crafting table shaped recipe\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly(output[], input, sequence[]) \n// output[] are your output items\n// input is your input item\n// sequence[] is an array of sequences. These sequences are \"regular\" recipes that are supported.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createCrushing([\n  '2x minecraft:cobblestone',\n  'minecraft:redstone',\n  Item.of('minecraft:redstone').withChance(0.5)\n], 'minecraft:redstone_ore')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMixing('create:chromatic_compound', [\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:polished_rose_quartz'\n]).superheated()\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createFilling('create:blaze_cake', [\n  'create:blaze_cake_base',\n  Fluid.of('minecraft:lava', 250)\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createEmptying([\n  'minecraft:glass_bottle',\n  Fluid.of('create:honey', 250)\n], 'minecraft:honey_bottle')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting('minecraft:piston', [\n  'CCCCC',\n  'CPIPC',\n  'CPRPC'\n], {\n  C: '#forge:cobblestone',\n  P: '#minecraft:planks',\n  R: '#forge:dusts/redstone',\n  I: '#forge:ingots/iron'\n})\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly([ // start the recipe\n Item.of('6x create:large_cogwheel').withChance(32.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n Item.of('create:brass_ingot').withChance(2.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n 'minecraft:andesite', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'create:cogwheel', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:stick', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:iron_nugget' // have this item be a guaranteed output\n], 'create:brass_ingot', [ // 'create:brass_ingot' is the input.\n// the transitional item set by \"transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel')\" is the item that will be used during the recipe as the item that the input is using to transition to the output.\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:planks']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array.

Input and output have the transitional item\n event.recipes.createCutting('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', 'create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').processingTime(50) // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n]).transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').loops(6) // set the transitional item and the loops (amount of repetitions)\n```\n\nIf you want to use your own transitional item in sequenced_assembly recipes, you must register it in startup event:\n\n```javascript\nonEvent('item.registry', event => {\n  // Texture for this item goes in kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/item/my_part.png\n  event.create('my_part', 'create:sequenced_assembly').displayName('My Part')\n})\n```\n\nThen you would use ...`transitionalItem('kubejs:my_part')`...\n\n> Note! Mysterious Conversion recipes are client side only, so the only way to add them currently is using reflection with this code in client scripts (outside any event):\n\n```javascript\nlet MysteriousItemConversionCategory = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.category.MysteriousItemConversionCategory')\nlet ConversionRecipe = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.ConversionRecipe')\n\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:apple', 'minecraft:carrot'))\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:golden_apple', 'minecraft:golden_carrot'))\n```\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)","published":"2023-08-21T20:20:41.279415Z","updated":"2023-11-20T15:07:35.257690Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":20097,"followers":20,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["library"],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["MO75e2sC","YN0T5Pmf","dvLO7wuv","T4V6Dm0l","cNEVOQ4q","bnvthbJW","uMNhEyBG","79c3Pl6W","VwLRcUBQ","Khlo8swW","b3ZbuHEY","eRR2DuIi","CDoBzOhr","qmHwp7h4","gUgBKKro","r6cVLbDS","I3cYQ3mX","pLyqKVXT","ftDL2MOo","XABryG8V","VszJSnhB","1INYEb9w","oRValdcl","mHfUZDSO","m9lk8iMr","65oHVwN8","VLiijTOY","rJ26X7G5","2Hq8tbrn","dxY7VzQv","zWLaf3WR","Yp60zntL","B4zWSIIO","8qUQlsto","zmzcrZEp","y7FC6Rsp","YE9yQwxx","353BVKVV","hYdnSDQB","13yE1QX6","Jqn5DRIj","A0KQFxde","Xe2y2pRp","FhVbUfLB","ClnUsQ85","HJ0xIlkM","PB33MOc1","hei9cDRa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T38eAZQC/511b709655f4853df9ff9f3731fc1df6d2c4a20a.png"},"version":{"id":"hei9cDRa","project_id":"T38eAZQC","author_id":"7tgPcl7v","featured":false,"name":"KubeJS

Adds Thermal-style tools and equipment!\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Innovation\" - a collection of things which increase player-centric power - useful tools, gadgets, and armor.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

great king and founder of Thebes, Cadmus allows both players\nand server admins to protect their land from thieves and certain environmental\nelements.\n\nPlayers can claim land as an individual or as a [team](https://modrinth.com/mod/argonauts).\nServer owners can use the admin claim feature to claim chunks no player may touch,\nand even further than that, they can use the region flags system to enable or disable\ncertain rules from occuring in the claimed admin chunks\n\n### Land claiming\n![Very pog team claim shown on

(A new take on the Builder's Wand)","body":"# Construction Wand\n\nWith a Construction Wand you can place multiple blocks (up to 1024) at once, extending your build on the side you're\nfacing. If that's not enough: you can upgrade your wand with additional cores, allowing you to place a block behind the\nblock you are facing, conjure blocks in mid air or destroy lots of blocks very fast.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/images/c9dc4b40da63d535f90020335804e089addb5896.png)\n\n**Note:** These are the instructions for ConstructionWand version 2.0+, which introduced some new features.\nIf you are still using version 1.x, refer to [those](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/tree/1.16.2-1.7)\ninstructions.\n\n## Wands\n\nThere are basic wands made from stone, iron and diamond and the Infinity wand. Wands from higher tiers are more powerful\nand last longer. These properties can be changed in the config.\n\n| Wand     | Durability  | Max. Blocks | Upgradeable | Angel distance | Max. Blocks (Destroy) |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Stone    | 131         | 9           | No          | -              | -                     |\n| Iron     | 250         | 27          | Yes         | 1              | 9                     |\n| Diamond  | 1561        | 128         | Yes         | 4              | 25                    |\n| Infinity | Unbreakable | 1024        | Yes         | 8              | 81                    |\n\n## Crafting\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting1.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting2.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting3.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting4.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting5.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting6.png)\n\n## Keybindings\n\nTo change a wand's core and options or undo your placement you need to hold down the wand option key\n(refered as OPTKEY). By default, this is CTRL, but it can be changed in the client config file. To prevent unwanted\nchanges to your options, you can configure that you have to hold down SNEAK as well to change options or open up the\nGUI.\n\n## Wand cores\n\nWand cores are magical gemstones that make your wand do its thing.\n\nEvery wand comes with a Construction core. You can make your wand even better by putting\naditional cores into it. Put your new core together with your wand in a\ncrafting grid to install it. To switch between cores, hold down OPTKEY and left click empty space\nwith your wand.\nStone wands can't be upgraded.\n\n**Construction core**\n\nExtend your build on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nHold down OPTKEY and scroll to change placement restriction\n(Horizontal, Vertical, North/South, East/West, No lock).\n\n**Angel core**\n\nPlace a block on the opposite side of the block (or row of blocks) you are facing. Maximum distance depends\non wand tier. Right click empty space to place a block in midair (similar to angel blocks, hence the name).\nTo do that, you'll need to have the block you want to place in your offhand. You can't place a block in midair\nif you've fallen more than 10 blocks deep (no easy rescue tool from falling into the void).\n\n**Destruction core**\n\nDestroy blocks (no tile entities) on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nRestrictions work just like with the Construction core. Destroyed blocks disappear into the void,\nyou can use the undo feature if you've made a mistake.\n\n## Options\nSNEAK+OPTKEY+Right clicking empty space opens the option screen of your wand.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/options.png)\n\n**Restriction:** If restriction is enabled the wand will only place blocks in one row or column\n(choose between North/South, East/West on a horizontal plane and Horizontal, Vertical on a vertical plane).\nIf the direction lock is switched off, the wand will extend the entire face of the building it's pointed at. This option\nhas no effect if the angel core is enabled.\n\n**Direction:** If set to \"Player\" the wand places blocks in the same direction as if they were placed by yourself.\nTarget mode places the blocks in the same direction as their supporting block. See the picture below:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/placedir.png)\n\n**Replacement:** Enables/disables the replacement of replaceable blocks (Fluids, snow, tallgrass).\n\n**Matching:** Select which blocks are extended by the wand. If set to \"EXACT\" it will only extend blocks that\nare exactly the same as the selected block.<br>\n\"SIMILAR\" will treat similar blocks equally (e.g. extend dirt and grass blocks).<br>\n\"ANY\" will extend any block on the face of the building you're looking at.\n\n**Random:** If random mode is enabled, the wand places random blocks from your hotbar.<br>\n~~Shamelessly stolen~~ Inspired by the Trowel from Quark.\n\n## Undo\n\nHolding down Sneak+OPTKEY while looking at a block will show you the last blocks you placed with a green border around\nthem. Sneak+OPTKEY+Right clicking any of them will undo the operation, giving you all the items back. If you used the\nDestruction core, it will restore the blocks.\n\n## Additional features\n\n- Shulker boxes, bundles (MC 1.17+) and many containers from other mods can provide building blocks for the wand\n\n- Botania compatibility: The Black Hole Talisman can supply blocks just like shulker boxes can. Having a Rod of the\n  Lands / Rod of the Depths in your inventory will provide you with infinite dirt/cobble at the cost of Mana.\n\n- Having blocks in your offhand will place them instead of the block you're looking at\n\n- Look at your statisics to see how many blocks you have placed using your wand\n\n- **1.16+ only:** The Infinity Wand won't burn in lava just like netherite gear.\n\n- Ingame documentation with Just Enough Items (JEI)\n\n## TileEntity Blacklist\n\nSome modded TileEntitys can cause issues when placed using a wand. They may turn into invisible and\nunremovable ghost blocks, become unbreakable or cause other unwanted effects.\n\nThat's why I've included a Black/Whitelist system\nfor TileEntities in CW Version 1.7. Chisels&Bits blocks are blacklisted by default.\nThere are probably a few other tile entities from other mods out there which may cause issues as well.\nIf you find some of them you can tell me by creating\nan issue, commenting on Curse or editing the default blacklist yourself\n(it is located at https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/blob/1.19/src/main/java/thetadev/constructionwand/basics/ConfigServer.java#L25)\nand making a PR.\n","published":"2023-02-12T15:35:19.530389Z","updated":"2023-10-22T13:16:37.001996Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":14698,"followers":28,"categories":["equipment"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["rrqylZBD","3ot5Oyha","mu10EfcP","igLNVPcs","9MN5qjpv","Sm161M7C","NiITg4f7","L2xX0NNB","wOUcCQZq","En39T7ce","oYFaTF5x","5sOBinxu","aHdfYfXB","euErdk9r","MQCbEsYE","XCgKj8gL","hOOCABkw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/97e36b528d64cde8be387379f2768eddac003c89.png"},"version":{"id":"XCgKj8gL","project_id":"bV2crgLh","author_id":"5Q6TFGke","featured":false,"name":"Construction Wand 1.20.1-2.11","version_number":"1.20.1-2.11","changelog":"**ConstructionWand 2.11**\nNow available for MC 1.20\n\n- Fixed [#76](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/issues/76) Logic issue with placement\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-05T20:03:02.535254Z","downloads":7386,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"80bd5223cd8984dc1038cb9f2d1cb6b97f31998a","sha512":"a029f801dbcfacd230650fd018f7424535454fb2062d796cbe9cd622a9fe4ae80cb0d7883faa2775c27ed73a21dffbadb44ddc32ce1293ec098654393e7b1c95"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/versions/XCgKj8gL/constructionwand-1.20.1-2.11.jar","filename":"constructionwand-1.20.1-2.11.jar","primary":true,"size":210312,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"e9S8rgYI","user":{"id":"5Q6TFGke","username":"theta-dev","name":"ThetaDev","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19636565?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-08-24T15:23:28.923449Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"constructionwand-1.20.1-2.11.jar"},"mods\\thermal_expansion-1.20.1-11.0.0.27.jar":{"sha512":"d527513e7117930ed9eb47d4cf8f1430c6f56386af361cfe6eb2a249448638a07385ffda21aa1646ee83905b0740317cc22df4c5274b02940556d1301c603786","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"hmD6rrUJ","slug":"thermal-expansion","project_type":"mod","team":"MsgUAFtY","title":"Thermal Expansion","description":"Expanding Minecraft Thermally!

A server-friendly and content-rich blend of magic and technology!\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Expansion\" - the original mod in the series, going all the way back to Minecraft 1.2.5. It contains the \"industrial base\" of the Series, providing options for energy generation, storage, and resource processing!\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2024-02-12T21:57:45.411467Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":572214,"followers":377,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku","8UWgitat","AgF88xAa","LAcFOrdR","3sq8rKNi","WXnNfkOQ","bRdRjsBw","2RKyBUJh","8BAEKNuN","cEVwMp3J","5NKdFoez","StBAz5jK","dRWTiq1o","dLc984Lh","OWzOhWa1","IVjsKfDz","cFgWr0uf","wnLFf0Nc","rCLaOh9e","zxsIL6hW","DKi9sJC8","7wOWxvtd","BMFYaPZ4","pg9Xxrcb","t5FnO6dP","zQA9lTQr","cv8vKRPe","TDf2CeG9","FubHdmUL","7NLlFrFF","8og81efu","NBLqXmpa","IZUE22nG","JQtrjbXM","Ss8gDP6F","Jv6lR8aV","Fi0TCD7O","6AG0cMX6","uMZCwusw","oi8DYts3","5QbwmlBE","n3GjNlx6","ycRzQlXJ","oTRatPAP","yquNskKL","CbCy1LiO","M8sd9nyu","e93w6V0s","hCmcGN2x","WtQPtpOg","OkmMqBP5","ypbJKwW0","wwZF0CTX","fNxFC0pt","PXdkmy2e","favv6G7H","jOzdT1LR","gnSKWxm4","ZgfYQJJR","7PV35Cya","s2SeQuIY","JDl2M220","LdkViV3L","kxERHwYJ","njpFMA6B","pk2qJx6m","UnP0v4AC","aeiy0BML","Go1eYHmQ","Cuzt6kYP","js8YrtNd","Asee8uGo","UYBCMpsC","iAUu6joU","xGNGCHkB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/twkfQtEc/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ypbJKwW0","project_id":"twkfQtEc","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"forge_1.20-2.9.3","version_number":"forge_1.20-2.9.3","changelog":"more

A fork of the much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of new features.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> I'm not sure what that is [...] I don't know where that came from.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, December 2020](https://youtu.be/D8Ue9I-SKeM?t=980)\n\n> It is basically ComputerCraft. It has the turtles, and the computers, and writing Lua programs and all that stuff.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, May 2022](https://youtu.be/7Ruq33XmQIQ?t=537)\n\n\n## Features\nControlled using the [Lua programming language][lua], CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start\nwriting code and automating your Minecraft world.\n\n![A ComputerCraft terminal open and ready to be programmed.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/basic-terminal.png)\n\nWhile computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. *Turtles* are the\nsolution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub]. If you've got any ideas, feedback or bugs please do [create an issue][bug].\n\n[github]: https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/ \"CC: Tweaked on GitHub\"\n[bug]:

Config Lib","description":"Config Lib makes dealing with config files just a bit easier.","body":"![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

I have no desire to do a complete rebranding, Rubidium compatibility is still a priority, but sometimes you may need to download an older version of Rubidium Extra for the game to work properly!\n\n# Features\nHere is a basic rundown of what this mod does.\n+ Animations Settings (Control fire, water, lava, block animations and etc...)\n+ Particles Settings (Control all types of particles, including ones from other mods)\n+ Details Settings (Control sky, stars, sun/moon, weather, and much more)\n+ Render Settings (Control fog, static entities, and other miscellaneous renderings)\n+ Extra Settings (Display FPS, coordinates, toast notifications, clouds, and much more)\n\nSee a more detailed explanation of what features are included in Embeddium Extra [here](https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/wiki/Features).\n\n# Modpack Permissions\nThis is a free and open-source project; you can include it in your mod pack as long as you provide attribution!\n\n# Common Questions\n+ **Do I need Rubidium/Embeddium installed for this mod to work?** You will need to download Rubidium or Embeddium for this mod to work.\n+ **Can I re-host/upload this mod somewhere else?** No.\n+ **Will you add x features to this mod?** Ask the original author about it, you can do it [here](https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/issues).\n+ **For any other questions, please contact our [discord](https://discord.gg/jdB5JYX7W7 \"Discord\")!**\n\n#### Some information
